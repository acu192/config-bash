# Ryan's Bash Config for Linux and MacOS

This config:
1. sets the prompt contents and colors to look nice,
2. creates some handy aliases,
3. points the `PATH` to where my `bin` repo usually resides, and
4. sets other misc `bash` and `env` things to make it behave like I like it.

### How to install

Clone this repo, navigate to the root of the repo, and run `make`.

Restart your bash session and reap your rewards.
